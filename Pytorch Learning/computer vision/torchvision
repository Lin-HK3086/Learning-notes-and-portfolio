torchvision
    Contains datasets, model architectures and image transformations often used for computer vision problems.

torchvision.datasets
    Here you'll find many example computer vision datasets for a range of problems from
    image classification,
    object detection,
    image captioning,
    video classification and more.
    It also contains a series of base classes for making custom datasets.

torchvision.models
    This module contains well-performing and commonly used computer vision model architectures implemented in PyTorch,
    you can use these with your own problems.

torchvision.transforms
    Often images need to be transformed (turned into numbers/processed/augmented) before being used with a model,
    common image transformations are found here.

torch.utils.data.Dataset
    Base dataset class for PyTorch.

torch.utils.data.DataLoader
    Creates a Python iterable over a dataset (created with torch.utils.data.Dataset).
